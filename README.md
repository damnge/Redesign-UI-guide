# Redesign UI

Some time ago I was asked by the Canadian insurance company from Toronto to make an additional redesign of their homepage I would like to share it with you.

Below there is the link to the prototype of the final design page in Figma:

Also below you can find the link to see the whole page with different variations that were created to fulfill client needs and experiment with the position of different sections:

Also in this GitHub repository, you can find a photo that shows how the original website was looking at that time. The link to the photo is also pasted below:

## What was the website about?

In the original idea, it supposes to be a marketplace for life insurance for Canadian families. 

## Design Principles that I used

### White space

Every pixel was precisely calculated to create enough room for breathing for each text and section.  
In most of the examples Headings are 30px higher than paragraphs, and buttons are 50px lower than paragraph.  
The main content of the website has an 1160px width, and the margins on the side are 140px.  
Between section there is 160px distance.  
That helps users scan the website.  

### Right Typography

When it comes to typography we always try to stick to maximum 2 fonts so the website can keep a certain consistency
In this example for headings we have:
* Frank Ruhl Libre - we chose it because it's a serif that has a more serious and prestigious style than sans serif, this is an insurance company so we wanted to keep a certain style and solid traditional look.
for paragraphs we have:
* Cabin - easy to read sans serif, which matches well with Frank Rhul Libre, in most cases, you will always prefer to go with sans serif for paragraphs. 

### Color Pallet

In this example, color pallet was already selected so I couldn't do much about it I've just added an accent color - dark navy blue, that stands against the dark red.

### Aligment

All the elements in the design of the homepage are aligned according to 12 column grid with a 30px gutter and a 140px margin on the side.


### CTA Buttons

There are two types of buttons primary button and a secondary button which highlight the importance and where the User is supposed to be led. 

### Avoid too much text

As you can notice texts are very short with lots of white space so the User is not overwhelmed with the amount of information.
Remember we don't read we scan with our eyes.

### Right Fonts Size

Fonts' sizes are selected to highlight different sections and create a certain visual hierarchy.  
For main headings H1 - it's 48px.   
font size of paragraphs - stays on 18px.  
In some cards, we have H2 - 35px.  
H5 - 18px. 

### Aditional Touch

The line that goes through the whole website is supposed to represent the lifeline of the human hand.
In the end, it's an insurance website that serves life insurance for families.
